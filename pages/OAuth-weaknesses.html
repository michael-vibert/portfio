          <h3>What is Oauth?</h3>
          <p>
            This is a popular authorisation protocol used by large corporations such as Facebook 
            and Google which is designed to let third party clients have limited access to user 
            information (like your email contact list) without ever having access to the users 
            credentials.  It is designed specifically for use in internet applications using HTTP. 
            It functions by giving an "access token" which is used to authorise the user to the third 
            party. This access token specifies the scope and lifetime of the granted access. 
            So the end-user should always control over how much data gets shared with third party 
            clients. 
          </p>

          <p>
            An overview example of this is where Barbara wants to grant a printing service access 
            to her google photos account. She can do so using Oauth protocols in the following steps:
          </p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>The client application requests access to a subset of Barbara's data</li>
            <li>Barbara authenticates with a "Authentication Server" which is trusted by Google photos </li>
            <li>The Authentication server issues a access token</li>
            <li>The access token with it's specified scope and lifetime is provided to the printing service</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Oftentimes the authorisation 
            server and the Resource server are the same enitity (like Facebook)
          </p>
          <p>Oauth defines 4 specific roles:</p>
            
          <ol>
            <li>Resource owner - This is usually a person who is the owner of resources to be shared and can be called the end-user (Barbara)</li>
            <li>Resource server - the server that is holding the protected resources. (Google Photos)</li>
            <li>Client - An application that is making the resource request on behalf of the resource owner (Okta)</li>
            <li>Authorisation Server - the server that issues access tokens
              <ul>
              <li style="margin-left: 40px;">This requires the successfully authentication of Barbara & authorisation from Barbara</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <!-- image supplied https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth -->
          <img class="secondary-img" src="../images/oath-protocol.png" alt="image depicting the oath protocol">
          
          <p>There are several pieces of data that are transmitted during the Oauth protocol:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Client_id - this is a mandatory parameter containing a unique public identifier of the client app</li>
            <li>Redirect_uri - The URL that the user is redirected to after authorisation is complete. </li>
            <li>State - this is a unique value that is assigned to a current session on the client app. It serves as a type of CSRF token</li>
            <li>Access_token - the token that the client uses to make requests on behalf of the resource owner</li>
          </ol>

          <p>There are different types of access grants but the most common is the Implicit flow. 
            This type of grant has 5 main steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Authorisation request</li>
            <li>User login and consent given</li>
            <li>Access token is granted</li>
            <li>API call to the resource server</li>
            <li>Resource grant</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>What sort of attack might work on Oath?</h3>
          <p>It is well established that OAuth can allow configuration weaknesses that can lead 
            to attackers being able to gain access to "leaked" authorisation codes and access tokens. 
            With these codes and tokens an attacker would potentially have full access to the users 
            account on the client service. 
          </p>
          <p>In the implicit flow of OAuth authentication the access token is sent from the OAuth 
            service to the client application via the user's URL. The client application accesses this 
            token with Javascript and generally stores this info somewhere. To prevent this user 
            information from being the stored, the client often submits this data to the server in 
            a "post request" and a session cookie is granted. The session cookie acts as a login for 
            the user. It is this "post request" that is vulnerable to attack from a man in the browser 
            attack. Because this session cookie doesn't contain any user secret data to compare with the 
            data it has been submitted. Meaning that the client server is now implicitly trusting the cookie. 
            Basically, if you can intercept this session cookie, you should be able to access the user's client 
            account in full.   
          </p>
          <h3>My Conclusions</h3>
          <p>
            The main thing that sticks out for me about MFA and OAuth is that when you increase the number 
            of steps to login to a user account, or when you do so (but abstract the details away from 
            the user) this greatly increases the attack surface. Particularly with OAuth there are so many 
            different communications between servers, clients, and users that all have access codes, URL redirects, 
            tokens and authorisation codes all of which are excellent targets for motivated hackers. The price we 
            pay for increased security is  decreased convenience and encouraging users to understand these facts 
            is of utmost importance. The other brief note I have noticed for the security engineer is the number 
            of mentions throughout the research I have conducted about the importance of correct implementation 
            and configurations of protocols in systems. The idea behind a secure protocol may be sound but if it 
            is incorrectly implemented it is useless.
