          <p>
            The Microsoft Hello authentication system is a biometric based authentication system that uses facial recognition to allow 
            user access to their personal computers. In 2021 there was a vulnerability discovered that 
            allowed hackers access to the systems using only an image of the victim. Find out how below.
          </p>

          <p>
            The exploitation was discovered by CyberArk Labs were they used a USB that tricked the system into accepting a 
            (infrared) image of the victim. 
          </p>
          <p>Of course, the attacker requires physical access to the victim's computer, so the 
            exploitability is difficult. There was no evidence that this attack had 
            been actually exploited but it serves as a reminder of these types of possibilities. 
          </p>
          <p>CyberArk Labs produced a 6 step method for exploiting this weakness.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Obtain or produce a infra-red image of the victim</li>
            <li>Create a custom USB device that impersonates a USB camera</li>
            <li>Attacker installs this data onto a USB</li>
            <li>Attacker inserts UBS into victims system at start up</li>
            <li>The biometric system accepts the data as legitimate </li>
            <li>Attack then has access to the victims system</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>The overview of how the Windows Hello Biometric Authentication System Works.
          </p>
          
        <!-- image supplied https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/bypassing-windows-hello-without-masks-or-plastic-surgery -->
        <img class="secondary-img" src="../images/biometric-flow-chart.webp" alt="Flow chart of biometric authentication system">
          
          <p>The system gets information from the system camera, it then sends it for biometric analysis where it is 
            compared with previous data. It then makes a decision and sends back its analysis to the initial function that requested it. 
          </p>
          <p>The camera that is embedded in most personal computers is a type of USB device, and this is at the heart 
            of how the vulnerability can be exploited. Because the authentication system accepts input from a USB camera 
            device, this can be replicated because USB cameras are external devices.   
          </p>
          <p>A Camera that is used for biometric scanning is a standard camera, that supports RGB and infra-red. 
            This is two separate sensors that work together to produce an image. It turns out the verification is 
            performed using the IR image.</p>
          <p>They verified this by running an experiment where they overlapped the normal RGB image of 
            Spongebob Squarepants with the IR image of "victim". They sent that data to the authentication system and it
             allowed them access. </p>
          <p>They also discovered that they only needed 1 frame of the victim, not a whole real of frames like a video. They used
             a single IR frame and a single solid black frame and that was enough to gain access. </p>
          <p>The attacker therefor needs to take a normal image of the victim and turn it into an IR image, 
            or obtain an IR image themselves. Both of these situations are feasible but it's more simple to obtain 
            a IR image yourself by surreptitiously taking a photo of the target. </p>
          <h3>My Conclusions</h3>
          <p>
            Given how our biometric data is available to everyone who can see our websites and social media accounts, 
            people who see us on the streets 
            and basically anywhere we have ever been due to CCTV. It is 
            important to think seriously about the use of said data for accessing
             important information. Although the example discussed above has been patched and no longer works, 
            there will always be the next version of this. Our biometrics are a very convenient form 
            of authentication for users to implement, but the risk is also great. To compare with a user password, 
            if there is evidence of unauthorised access or a data breach you can always change your password. 
            But you cannot change your face. Not easily anyway. Therefor a breach in this data or 
            a dependable method of spoofing is potentially consequential for the rest of your life.
